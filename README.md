In the age of smart homes, the ability to predict energy consumption not only may produce a saving, but may even result in more money generation by giving excess energy back to Grid (e.g. in the case of solar panels usage); it can furthermore be crucial to detect abnormal energy use patterns, to be part of an energy management system for load control and to model predictive control applications where the loads are needed. The aim of this study is to predict Appliance energy usage based on data collected from different sensors through regression analysis.
